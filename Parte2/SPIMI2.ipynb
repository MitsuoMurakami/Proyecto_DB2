Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on? She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, Baby, I just want to dance With my pretty little Galway Girl You're my pretty little Galway Girl You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool After dancing the cÃ©ili singing to trad tunes I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, Baby, I just want to dance My pretty little Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night I walked her home then she took me inside To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write About a Galway Girl and a perfect night She played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, Baby, I just want to dance My pretty little Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\"\n",

Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on? She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, Baby, I just want to dance With my pretty little Galway Girl You're my pretty little Galway Girl You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool After dancing the cÃ©ili singing to trad tunes I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, Baby, I just want to dance My pretty little Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night I walked her home then she took me inside To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write About a Galway Girl and a perfect night She played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, Baby, I just want to dance My pretty little Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl' \n",

My father will be pacing the floor Listen to that fireplace roar So really I'd better scurry Beautiful, please don't hurry Well maybe just a half a drink more Why don't you put some records on while I pour The neighbors might think Baby, it's bad out there Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there I wish I knew how Your eyes are like starlight To break the spell I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell I ought to say no, no, no, sir Mind if I move in closer? At least I'm gonna say that I tried What's the sense in hurting my pride? I really can't stay Baby don't hold out Baby it's cold outside I simply must go See that it's cold outside The answer is no I said it's cold out there This welcome has been How lucky that you dropped in So nice and warm Look out the window at that storm My sister will be suspicious Gosh, your lips look delicious My brother will be there at the door Waves upon a tropical shore My maiden aunt's mind is vicious Oh, your lips are delicious Maybe just a cigarette more Never such a blizzard before Hey I've got to go home Baby, you'll freeze out there Say, lend me your coat It's up to your knees out there You've really been grand I'm thrilled when you touch my hand But don't you see How can you do this thing to me? There's bound to be talk tomorrow Think of my life long sorrow At least there will be plenty implied If you caught pneumonia and died I really can't stay Get over that old lie Baby, baby it's cold outside\"",
